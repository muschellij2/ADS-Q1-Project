 For a number of years I saw this pink parade through the streets of Everett and wanted to know more of this cause. As a massage therapist I learned that some of my clients taken part on this parade for many years. 
  Friends who have suffer from this cancer at  Lopez island, and here in Everett was part of my inspiration for the walk. I also wanted to help a friend who has helped me realize that  strength in numbers makes light work! As for my daughter she is already talking to her new friends she made during this venture.

A DBT (D 3)-ABUS combination machine will enable detection of up to 95% of early breast cancers.
               
 Ian Grant-Whyte, MA MD (Cambridge,) LMCC (Canada), ABFP Ret. (USA)
 
My relentless crusade to help women young and old discover breast cancers early began on 23 June 2007, my daughter Julie's 50th birthday, when an MRI revealed a large breast cancer (10x4 cms) which had gone undetected by years of negative mammograms and inadequate clinical breast examinations. Crucially, ultrasound was never ordered.
 
According to Harvard Radiology Professor, Daniel Kopans, a world authority on breast cancer imaging and the inventor of the \"Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), now called 3D mammography, is available in the United States.
 
“It is a better program and it detects some cancers that are not visible on D 2 mammography. However, there are still cases where an ultrasound can detect cancers not evident on DBT alone. The combination of DBT and 3D automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) will find many more cancers at an early, curable stage than in D 2 mammography.”
 
Dr Kopans believes that a DBT-ABUS combination machine will enable detection of up to 95% of early breast cancers.

I recently introduced Dr. Kit Vaughan, PhD,(Caperay.com) , to Prof. Daniel Kopans in the hope that they will collaborate and be able to combine DBT and ABUS in a single unit). The development of a successful DBT-ABUS system will be a daunting, time-consuming, and expensive task.
 
The new DBT-ABUS system would make it technically much easier for the radiologist to read images and reduce possible diagnostic errors. It would also enable the detection of more cancers at an earlier, curable stage, particularly in women with dense breast tissue. With just one visit there would be far less anxiety while waiting for results. This would be less expensive than two consecutive visits.

Dr. Vaughan has estimated that it would require $250,000 to build a clinic-ready system combining DBT and ABUS, to be sent to the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston for Dr. Kopans to evaluate in his breast imaging clinic.

I appeal to the thousands of men and women  who have lost loved ones to breast cancer to help finance this machine which has the potential to save countless women’s lives, including the 40% of women with dense breast tissue, who are not only at increased risk of developing breast cancer, but whose cancer may be missed by 2D mammography.
                          A priceless investment in women’s lives.

Combination therapy shows promise for chronic myeloid leukemia
http://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-09-combination-therapy-chronic-myeloid-leukemia.html 

A study in mice combining two inhibitor drugs for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has revealed potential for not only stopping the disease completely, but also significantly lowering the cost for treatment. CML is a cancer of the white blood cells accounting for 20 percent of adult leukemia.

The study at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center was led by Michael Andreeff, M.D., professor, and Bing Carter, Ph.D., professor, both of the department of Leukemia. Findings were published in the Sept. 7 online issue of Science Translational Medicine.

Researchers combined the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), with another inhibitor drug known as venetoclax, and observed encouraging response and cure rates for both the chronic phase of the disease and its fatal end-stage phase called blast crisis. BCR-ABL inhibitors are the current standard-of-care treatment allowing most patients to remain in remission, but they do not entirely eradicate the cancer cells. In some patients, the cancer returns in a form that is untreatable. Approximately 100,000 patients in the U.S. are kept on life-long TKI therapy at a cost of $100,000 annually, a treatment that is unaffordable for many patients.

\"Our results demonstrate that this study in mice employing combined blockade of BCL-2 and BCR-ABL has the potential for curing CML and significantly improving outcomes for patients with blast crisis, and, as such, warrants clinical testing,\" said Andreeff. \"This combination strategy may also apply to other malignancies that depend on kinase signaling for progression and maintenance.\"

TKIs for CML are the most successful class of molecular targeted therapy of any malignant disease, but are not effective in eliminating CML stem cells. Since the persistent stem cells could allow the cancer to return and advance to the fatal blast crisis stage, patients must remain on the drugs for the rest of their lives.

\"It is believed that TKIs do not eliminate residual stem cells because they are not dependent on BCR-ABL signaling,\" said Carter. \"Hence cures of CML with TKIs are rare.\"

Carter has worked for several years on eliminating the residual CML stem cells, which could mean CML patients no longer would require expensive lifelong TKIs. Based on this study, combining TKIs with BCL-2 inhibitor, an agent pioneered by Andreeff's group for use in both acute and chronic myeloid leukemias, may be a solution.

\"Long-term treatment with TKIs comes at a high cost, both in terms of side effects and financially,\" she said. \"Worldwide, most CML patients cannot afford the extraordinary expenses associated with TKI-based therapy. And, unfortunately, for patients who progress to blast crisis, there are no meaningful treatments and survival is counted in weeks or months.\""/t"2016-09-09T12:27:03+0000"/t"link"/t"http://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-09-combination-therapy-chronic-myeloid-leukemia.html"/t"14084625156_1202778536447873"/tNA/t0/t0/t0
"71"/t"1215606961831697"/t"Anthony Smith"/t"Every time I hear about someone suffering from a disease I think about how slow scientist, university research labs & hospital research labs are at finding cures. Just in 2015 alone Susan G. Komen total net public support & revenue was 250,276,362.. How close are scientist at finding cures for disease? Well, let's look at leukemia, published 9/8/2016 a study in mice by the University of Texas that combined two inhibitor drugs for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) may be able to cure the disease completely and also lower treatment costs notably. The current treatment costs $100,000 annually in the United States, and is unaffordable for most patients. How old is Cancer?  Humans have been dealing with cancer for as long as we know. The ancient Egyptians concluded back in 1600 B.C. that “there is no treatment” for the disease. How far have we come to finding a cure? The simple fact is that the cancer industry employs too many people and produces too much income to allow a cure to be found. All of the current research on cancer drugs is based on the premise that the cancer market will grow, not shrink."/t"2016-09-09T12:22:25+0000"/t"status"/tNA/t"14084625156_10157729504940157"/tNA/t0/t0/t0

We live in Summerville, SC and are trying to find as much help and support to be able to provide her with the treatment she needs. We are reaching out to you to see if you could provide us with any assistance, since she has been diagnosed with breast cancer. Due to the economic crisis Venezuela is going through, chemotherapy medication is almost non-existent. We were trying to pay for it ourselves, but on our  teacher salaries we can only provide minimal help. I've started a GoFundMe campaign: Orquidea's fight against Cancer.

She's currently on the disability wait list and her attorneys feel very strong that she'll get it. Her trial won't be until Feb or June of 2017. She's one Medicaid and they pay for 9 of her medications at 100% but there's 3 they pay very little for. Every month she struggles to find, beg for money to get her 3 medications. The most important one is her breast cancer remission medicine which she has to take for 5 year after being cleared. It's $170 every month after Medicaid pays their portion. If she runs out, the withdrawal is terrible in so many ways. I'm not sure if there's any way ya'll could help me help her, but I'd appreciate any suggestions or advice or help.

 Harvard Radiology Prof. Daniel Kopans, a world authority
on breast cancer imaging, and the inventor of the latest D3 [D B T]. states:
 

“There are still cases where an ultrasound can detect cancers not evident on

D B T ( D 3) and the combination of DBT(D 3 and 3D Automated Breast

Ultrasound

 (ABUS) will find many more cancers at an early, curable stage, up to

95 percent of early breast cancers.”

 I appeal to the thousands of men and women who have lost

loved ones to breast cancer to help finance this machine

which has the potential to 

save countless women’s lives, including the 40 percent of women 

with dense breast tissue, who are not only at increased risk of

developing breast cancer, but whose cancer may be 

missed by 2D mammography.

                           A priceless investment in women’s lives!

 Dr. Vaughan has estimated that it would require $250,000 to build a

 clinic-ready systemcombining DBT and ABUS, to be sent to the 

Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston for Dr. Kopans to

evaluate in his breast imaging clinic.

Letters to the Editor,
Paradise Valley Independent Newspaper,Arizona.

Dear Editor,
Many thanks for publishing my article on early detection of breast cancer.

                      The article went far and wide !

This is a comment I received from Ali, Joan Lunden’s assistant.
Joan herself is a breast cancer survivor , and one of America’s most beloved journalists.

“Hi Ian, Thank you so much for sharing your article from the Town of Paradise Valley Independent. We enjoyed reading this piece. Your message is right on target with all of the other research that comes through our office. We appreciate you bringing it to our attention. Wishing you the best. Ali”
                                              
                                        Please Read on!

According to Harvard Radiology Prof. Daniel Kopans, a world authority on breast cancer imaging, and the inventor of the latest D 3 [D B T],
“There are still cases where an ultrasound can detect cancers not evident on

D B T( D 3), and the combination of D B T(D 3 and 3 D Automated Breast Ultrasound (ABUS) will find many more cancers at an early, curable stage, up to 95 percent of  breast cancers.      

Funding for what will ultimately, undoubtedly turn out to be a Mammography Machine used Universally, will be a tremendous tool in early detection of breast cancer.  

                  Your urgent financial support would be much appreciated.

For further information on the D 3 (D B  T)-A B U S, and to validate the article’s scientific contents, please contact Harvard Radiology Professor Daniel Kopans: dkopans@partners.org or617 726 3093 

For technical information on the system that will combine the DBT and ABUS, please contact 
Dr. Kit Vaughan at: kit@caperay.com or + 27 72 795 8099.

Sincerely,

Ian.

"159"/t"841277776007416"/t"Anderia Kuch"/t"On July 20, 2016 I went in for a mammogram. So I made an appointment to get this done. I went in for my mammograms. I received a call to come in for more on my mammograms and an ultrasound. I was told I had some calcium deposits on my left side and a mass on my right. After those were done a week later I went in to talk with the doctor about the results.  Then they wanted me to get a biopsy on the left side only. They told me that they had good news and bad news. The good news was that I don't have cancer. The bad news is that I have Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS)  It quite frankly scared me. The said that this is a precursor to pre-cancer. So I could develop breast cancer in one or both breast in the future.  I was told I need to get this out either by a lumpectomy or a mastectomy. So I decided to see 2 surgeons who both said I should get a lumpectomy. I am going to get an MRI on Tuesday, August 23. I was told that I have a 20% chance of developing breast cancer in the future, I don't know what to do. They say I should wait and make a decision after the MRI of whether to get a lumpectomy or a mastectomy."/t"2016-08-21T02:20:57+0000"/t"status"/tNA/t"14084625156_10157629151745157"/tNA/t0/t0/t0

They deserve the best care.
Please educate yourself about type of your breast cancer. I lost my mother due to that!!

Dr. Homayoon Sanati, oncologist.
He did not review my mother pathology report before starting her treatment, and gave her treatment for Her2 negative while she was Her2 positive! He did not review her pathology report after surgery again and did not review second opinion report about a detailed treatment plan. Patient was in pain and just gave her pain medication, her tumor marker was abnormal and he ignored that. 
As per standard of care she had to get Herceptin and had to continue that for one year but because this oncologist didn't review neither of my late mother reports, didn't give her Herceptin!!!
Cancer over spread was found by accident at ER of other hospital. Dr. Homayoon Sanati, after 2 years went through  her chart and found out cancer over spread. My mother died after a lot suffering, cancer patient deserve the best care. Its not fair an oncologist does not review a biopsy report which is base on the treatment plan.

"187"/t"10154168027813218"/t"Jessica Schechter"/t"Allow me to explain my story with you:

My name is Jessica and I am 24 years old. When I was only 18 years old my mother passed away from breast cancer. I was holding her hand just like I held her hand throughout all her treatments, she passed and I watched her take her last breath.  Following her death life continued going horribly wrong. First my family and I lost all our medical and dental insurance. Then both of my grandmother's passed away four months apart. I was left broken hearted, depressed and diagnosed with PTSD but couldn't afford any kind of therapy or medication because lost my insurance. I did however manage to graduate with my bachelor's degree, made the dean's list, and was asked to join an international honor society,Epsilon Pi Tao.  To make this story a little less long my father and I moved from Long island to Tampa in an attempt to prevent foreclosure on our home we could no longer afford. Things in tampa started off good but quickly went south. We are facing eviction this month and I have been offered a very good job in Upstate NY but do not have the funds for a  moving truck to get my belongings from Tampa to New York. If you could please share my gofundme account in attempt to raise money for a moving truck and maybe by some miracle a small apartment it would be greatly appreciated.

"193"/t"10210756242771759"/t"Mollee Ostrander Dagastino"/t"I am having a diagnostic mammogram on August 31 and then meeting with a breast surgeon Aug 31.  I found the lump on Tuesday night after coming home from work, and going to change my clothes... I'm a manager in a warehouse environment.  I change my clothes after every shift.. guess I got in the habit after years of changing out of school clothes and into play clothes, as my mother called them.  As I went to change out of the bra I'd been wearing and the straps dropped from my shoulders - the pain was almost instantaneous and like something i'd never felt before.. but I can describe it as feeling like a broomstick was shoved upward into my right breast.  It wasn't and it didn't happen ...but that's what it felt like.  I'd had some dull centralized aching in that spot off and on for a few weeks.. but chalked it up to the bra I'd been wearing.   THen I wondered, maybe it's from the inhaled corticosteroid I'd resumed using the month before for my asthma; but no... this was not a pain like that.  It's just .. different.  I don't have leakage from my nipple, but if I tried... I could express a small amount... and from time to times.. I've seen a slight sheen on it, as if there was leaking of some sort.  When I felt the paid.. I gasped and plopped down on the bed.  I immediately put myself into a self exam position and began to feel around. If the top of my breast is 12 o'clock the position of the lump is 6 o'clock... closer to the nipple.  It's the size of a pencil eraser.. maybe a little less.  The doctor.... the next day, found it too.  Something has been \"off\" with me the last month or so... health wise and I've not been able to put a finger on it...  I just felt odd.. I still do.  I'm a former Peorian... walked many of the walks in Peoria.  Now I'm in Memphis and other than visiting the breast MD... I don't know where to turn or whom to talk to.  My husband is scared, so are my adult kids.. I suppose I am but I'm also a bit relieved.. in that this \"odd\" feeling.... well, there was and is something to it.     Do all newly diagnosed women, feel this way?   Thank you for listening."/t"2016-08-13T03:19:12+0000"/t"status"/tNA/t"14084625156_10157589905750157"/tNA/t0/t0/t0

Ali is my older sister. She is a single mom who loves her family.  She has been battling breast cancer for approximately  7 years.  She got better but the cancer came back and she has more surgery and chemo approx 6 months ago. She started experiencing back pain about 3 months ago and the doctors find the cancer has spread to her spine. This is now stage 4 cancer. Because she just had a bunch of surgery and chemo 6 months ago her funds and leave are diminished. I want her to enjoy her time with her daughter and fight this 3rd battle. So if you can, please donate. Even if it's just $10/ $20. Please show her people care. If you can't donate please pray and share this info so hopefully others can help. Thank you!!

"251"/t"10207398357536996"/t"Ian Grant-whyte"/t"THE DREAM MAMMOGRAPHY MACHINE.

What never ceases to amaze me is we have the makings of an incredible mammography machine, a machine that can potentially discover up to 95% of all breast cancers, and nobody seems interested in getting it up and running?

The Digital Breast Tomyosynthesis DBT ( 3D) Ultra Sound Combo Mammography Machine will enable detection of up to 95% of early breast cancers , according to Harvard Radiology Professor, Daniel Kopans,a world authority on breast cancer imaging and one of the pioneers of the D B T  (D 3.) 

 My relentless crusade to help women young and old discover breast cancers early began on 23 June 2007, my daughter Julie's 50`th birthday when an MRI revealed a large breast cancer which had gone undetected by years of negative mammograms and inadequate clinical breast examinations.
Ultrasound  was never ordered (areyoudense.org).

 \"Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT), now called 3D mammography, has become available in the United States.   There are cases where an ultrasound can detect cancers not evident on DBT alone.  The combination will find many more cancers at an early, curable stage than in 2-D mammography.\" Professor Kopans.

I recently introduced Dr. Kit Vaughn, PhD, (www.caperay.com) to Prof. Daniel Kopans in the hope that they will collaborate and be able to combine DBT (D3) with Ultrasound in a single unit.  This will be a daunting, time-consuming, and expensive task.

The new DBT-ABUS system would make it technically much easier for the radiologist to read films and reduce possible diagnostic errors.
It would detect more cancers at an earlier, curable stage, particularly in women with dense breast tissue.   With one visit there would be far less anxiety while waiting for results.  This would be less expensive than two consecutive visits.

Dr. Vaughan has estimated that it would require $250,000 to build a  clinic-ready system combining DBT and ABUS, to send to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston for Dr. Kopans for evaluation.

I appeal to the thousands of men and women  who have lost love ones to breast cancer to help finance this machine which can save countless women`s lives as well as many of the 40% of women with dense breast tissue who are at increased risk of developing breast cancer.
                                      
                                        A priceless  investment in women`s lives!

It devastates me to tell you the latest chemo treatment has not been effective and the cancer has grown 3x larger. For this reason, I had to stop the chemo and have been left with few options for recovery. My oncologist at MD Anderson might be able to do surgery to try to remove the tumor. She is uncertain at this time. My only other option is enrolling in a clinical trial through MD Anderson that has been showing a great deal of promise. Both options would require me to stay for an extended time in Texas, in order to receive treatment.My insurance covers 80% of the medical expense outside of Michigan & this trial is not available in MI. Anyway, as much as I hate to ask & believe me…. It is very hard on my pride, but, I need help with expenses for housing, food, air fare, and the remaining 20% of medical expenses at MD Anderson in order to qualify. Since I will be there for several weeks, I am also trying to help get my daughter, Destanee by my side for this difficult time.
In the past, friends and family have donated over $7,000 to my Go Fund Me account, and helped me to stay alive and keep fighting. Unfortunately, the medical bills alone have exhausted those funds, despite the appearance that there is still $$ in the account.

"296"/t"10154456125858444"/t"Yeshaya Danny Moskowitz"/t"This is a request for help for a woman in Israel...
(it is totally 100% genuine) 
- Please share and spread this request as far as possible

Shalom.  My name is Esther Caplin, from Neve Daniel, Israel.
 
After a year of treatments for stage 4 breast cancer which has spread to my liver, my oncologist decided to put me on Ibrance (with Faslodex) providing me with a free 3-month supply of Ibrance that he had obtained from a former patient. 

Unfortunately, Ibrance is not one of the cancer drugs supplied on the health plan in Israel and my oncologist hoped to use the three month period to assess its effectiveness on me and to try to acquire more of the drug from Pfizer on compassionate grounds.

While the Ibrance has succeeded in halting the spread of the cancer, the request to Pfizer did not work out. As buying the drug was not a viable option, I began a search in my support group (Inspire) for women who were once on Ibrance and since moved to a different treatment, the idea being that some people have Ibrance that is no longer being used. I was successful so far in obtaining enough pills for two more months of treatment. 

I am asking you to please spread the word – if you know anyone who was once on Ibrance and wishes to donate her left over Ibrance pills, please contact me at esther.caplin@gmail.com

As I see it, the unused medicine eventually will be thrown out, but for me, every 21 pills means another month of life.
 
Thank you so much for passing this on to whomever you think may be able to help me.
 
In appreciation,
Esther Caplin

Please do NOT BUY from this website!
I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer 5/13/16 and had double Mastectomy 6/9/16. I ordered shirts from this company through their advertisement on Facebook, as I wanted to have a group picture with my children. I had a lot of complications, but finally recovering and hoping to start reconstruction process soon. 1 of the 6 shirts was missing. The only way to contact \"customer service\" is via email. I have made three attempts to contact them via email with no response. I explained in the 3rd email how upset and disappointed I was. I explained that when you're battling cancer it's about the moments and memories; would they please help. Currently I am filing a claim through PayPal to resolve the issue and if nothing else get my money back. After additional investigation, this sight has NO affiliation that I can find with the American Cancer Association or any Breast Cancer Awareness program; but they use the \"Pink Ribbon\" to advertise their products. Battling Cancer is hard enough; please do not let yourself get scammed like I did. Please check the American Cancer Associations site before buying online from a company advertising the Pink Ribbon......I do not want to see anyone else experience this frustration or disappointment!"/t"2016-07-18T13:51:24+0000"/t"status"/tNA/t"14084625156_10157470745930157"/tNA/t0/t0/t0

My brother-in-law was told by the hospital treating Julie that SGK was the one who ran out of funds and cut Julie's grant.  SGK contacted him and explained that the hospital contacts them and says they need so much funding for the year to help breast cancer patients.  SGK then writes a check for the full amount.  It is then the hospital who decides who gets what.  The hospital is the one who said her treatments would be covered in full.  The person at SGK is in contact with the hospital to try to find out what happened with the money granted to Julie.  We are hoping that this will all be worked out and Julie will get her full grant back.

While I apologize for my post, I am happy that my post got someone from SGK to call Glenn and that this will hopefully lead to a happy outcome.  As a 16 year breast cancer survivor myself, I am most grateful to SGK for their help with this situation and for all they do for people fighting breast cancer!!"/t"2016-07-12T21:18:39+0000"/t"status"/tNA/t"14084625156_10157445170255157"/tNA/t16/t8/t0

The Negative Mammogram and the Polar Bear.
Inspired by Nancy Cappello`s Story  www.areyoudense.org
 
 Dedicated to all who have lost loved ones to Breast Cancer.
 
My daughter Julie, on her 50th birthday was diagnosed with a large breast cancer, undetected by years of negative mammograms (Tumor Size 10.7x 4.3 cm), and  never was an ultrasound ordered.

It was only relatively recently when I read the Nancy Cappello`s story , I became aware that 40% of women have dense breast tissue , and  looking for breast cancers on a D 2 Mammogram,  was like” looking for a Polar Bear in a Snow Storm”

Digital Breast Tomosynthesis [ DBT] sometimes called D3 mammography, has become available in the United States this has proven vastly superior to the traditional D2. However in many cases an ultrasound has to follow in order to rule out further possible pathology

Harvard Radiology Prof. Daniel Kopan’s, a world authority on breast cancer imaging, and one of the pioneers of DBT, is anxious to combine D B T [D3] with ultrasound in a single unit

This project is going to be time consuming and expensive, $250,000.00
 When you consider the 40,000 women`s priceless lives that are lost each year, this seems a small price to pay

The advantages of this are several: The DBT-ABUS system would make it technically easier for the radiologist to read films, and reduce possible diagnostic errors.

Would detect more cancers at an earlier stage, particularly in women with dense breast tissue. (40%)

With one visit they would be far less anxiety while waiting for results.

Would be less expensive than two consecutive visits

Prof. Kopan’s is collaborating with Kit Vaughan PhD www.caperay.com , a company that has already developed a combined D 2 ultrasound mammography machine
  
To the thousands of men and women who have lost love ones to breast cancer, 
please help finance a machine that will undoubtedly save countless future women`s lives.  
 
 To the 40% of women with dense breast tissue, give that nasty Polar Bear nowhere to hide!

As we await a cure for this dreadful disease Breast Cancer, early detection remains of paramount importance.
 
The cornerstone in our ability to find breast cancers early, is mammography.
 
According to Harvard Radiology Professor. Daniel Kopans a world authority on breast cancer imaging, and one of the pioneers of the D B T.
 
“DBT picks up many cancers that are not visible on 2D mammography.  Ultrasound picks up a few more, but the test that finds the most cancers is MRI. 
If you said I could do only one test for breast cancer screening it would be MRI.   Unfortunately, MRI is very expensive and requires the intravenous injection of gadolinium, and there is now concern that gadolinium accumulates in the brain with unknown (hopefully none) consequences. 
 DBT is the best single test that is affordable and accessible to everyone.  Ultrasound could be added to find some more cancers, but MRI will detect the most cancers.”
 
What Professor  Kopans and Kitt VaughnPhD (WWW.CAPERAY.COM)  hope to do, is produce a State-Of-The-Art Mammogram Machine would combine both the D  B  T with Ultrasound. not an easy task.
 
This DBT-ABUS would  save many women from untimely deaths because
 the new DBT-ABUS system would make it technically easier for the Radiologist to read films ,and reduce possible diagnostic errors.
Would detect more cancers at an earlier stage, particularly in women with dense breasts.(40%)
 With one visit there would be far less anxiety while waiting for results.
 Less Expensive than two consecutive visits.

She gave me their email (fountainwatercoven@yahoo.com).

Finally, my husband is totally cancer free and he is healthy and strong now, after which he reported that he could breath well, was not experiencing any pains and felt the good cells in his body. four days later our family doctor, vincent, reported there were no signs of him having any trouble breathing or problems with physical tasks and cancer; Thank you lord, my husband is much alive with the helpof fountain waters. my husband is now able to breathe fully and deeply. His doctor reportedly says his liver is cancer free. That he does not seems to have a small amount of cancer in his liver and lungs again.

"412"/t"10208783772605013"/t"Alissa Korte Bousquet"/t"Best husband ever!!!

Today is my wife’s last chemotherapy treatment.  She has amazed me with her strength, courage, and positive attitude through it all.  She still has a few surgeries ahead of her but completing chemotherapy is huge milestone in her journey.  I  wanted to do something special during this last treatment to celebrate the end of her chemo and to show her the tremendous love and support she has from her friends and family.  I also wanted to honor her fight against cancer by providing a donation in her name towards breast cancer research.  To accomplish this I secretly sent a text to several of Alissa’s friends and family.  I asked them to help me surprise her by  showering her in roses during her last treatment.  I arranged for our local flower shop to take the orders.  Each rose was purchased for $10.00 with all of the proceeds being donated to Susan G. Komen towards breast cancer research.  I was amazed when the orders started rolling in!  We quickly reached 100 roses, then 300 roses, then 400.  When we reached 500 roses I told the flower shop to stop ordering roses and let all the remaining orders go entirely to the Susan G. Komen donation.  Together over 170 families wanted to purchase roses and we ended up raising over $4500 for breast cancer research.  The flower shop placed the roses in 36 vases and then put them in 6 small wicker baskets.  Alissa’s two teen aged daughters and four close friends (AKA Alissa’s Crew) made the delivery.  After presenting the rose baskets to my wife we share them with the other cancer patients receiving treatment today as a gift from our family.  Thanks so much for all the support from our friends and family!"/t"2016-06-23T19:29:46+0000"/t"photo"/t"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208058030901924&set=o.14084625156&type=3"/t"14084625156_10208058030901924"/t"Alissa Korte Bousquet added a new photo to Susan G.

Thanks to the new policy of legalizing cannabis in my state and have even lost my wife's kidney cancer, and it was really shocked and surprised when I see a lot of documentary on how the cannabis oil had helped many people to whom His family thought they never could do next undergoing several \"Chemo\" from the department of my heart, and I have to say a word of appreciation to Dr. Rick for timely intervention in the lives of my wife suffering from kidney cancer. As I write this testimony in this blog my wife is so strong and healthy even though you have not completed the total dosage \"for cannabis and medical consultation opportunity and get in touch with him if you are a cancer patient through their email:phoenixtears44@gmail.com) so you can lit more details
Treatment Regine:
I have a pretty big tolerance for marijuana, so I started off with a full grain of rice sized amount of oil instead of a half grain. I gradually increased the dosage every night until I reached a full gram each night. The standard protocol for Rick Simpson Oil is ingesting a total of 60 grams over the course of 2-3 months, but I had 70 grams in
total for safe measure. I used the excess as a topical skin care treatment, attacking the visible brown spots on my face and neck.
3 months later, my cancer was in full remission. Within 4 months, I am cancer-free and officially received a clean bill of health from my doctors. What they don’t know is that the majority of my treatment was using the Rick Simpson Oil. I did use some of the medication they prescribed, but it was in combination with the oil.
I am elated I want to continue sharing with people who are experiencing what I went through that there is absolutely hope and a cure out there. They just need to be proactive and aggressive with treatment, not wait until it is too late. Get your medication at Phoenix Tears via Email: (phoenixtears44@gmail.com)
In addition to being an effective cancer fighter, there are some nice side effects that come from using the Rick Simpson oil, for instance, I no longer need to take any pain killers. Just one or two drops of the oil will ease the pain and help you sleep like a baby. Best of all, its natural . . . Thanks to all the staff at Amsterdam’s Garden
who guided me throughout this journey. You guys are awesome!"/t"2016-06-21T09:20:19+0000"/t"status"/tNA/t"14084625156_10157354995995157"/tNA/t0/t0/t0

Please make sure this letter/article,submitted to Forbes Magazine, is read by people who can make an enormous difference in preventing women from untimely deaths from breast cancer.
The Negative Mammogram and The Polar Bear.
Inspired by Nancy Cappello`s Story www.areyoudense.org
Dedicated to all who have lost loved ones to Breast Cancer.
Ian Grant-Whyte MA MD (Cambridge) L M C C(Canada) A B F P (ret.) USA
In spite of all the money spent on research, the plethora of information coming from experts, did you ever wonder why 40,000 women continue to die every year in the USA from breast cancer?
There are many possible reasons, however over reliance on a negative mammogram maybe one of the main ones.
Recently, when I read Nancy Cappello`s Story: http://areyoudense.org, 
I came to fully realize the vital significance of dense breast tissue ,that occurs in 40% of women.
Nancy`s story was a real eye opener ! Nancy likens the problem with reading the
“so-called negative” mammograms, as” like looking for a polar bear in a snowstorm!”
Many years ago, while practicing in the United States, I failed to diagnose a breast cancer in a 45-year-old woman because of a negative mammogram undoubtedly due to dense breast tissue.
http://youtu.be/Jow33EWcBAo
My own daughter Julie, had a large breast cancer, undetected by years of negative mammograms, and inadequate Clinical Breast Examinations. (C B E)
None of her doctors, from excellent Institutions, ever ordered an Ultrasound?
.
As Julie`s Mom had died from breast cancer aged 59, an astute physician ordered an MRI, 
Tumor Size: 10.7 cm by 4.3 cm
My relentless crusade to help women young and old discover breast cancers early, began 
on 23 June 2007, Julie`s 50th birthday.
Years ago I made contact with Harvard Radiology Professor, Daniel Kopans, a world authority on breast cancer imaging, and one of the pioneers of the D B T
Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT), sometimes called 3D mammography, has become available in the United States.
This has proven vastly superior to traditional 2D mammography, revealing occult breast cancers that were previously missed.
However, in many cases an ultrasound has to follow in order to rule out further possible pathology.
The second technique is an Automated Breast Ultrasound (ABUS) that 
detects tumors missed by both 2D mammography and D B T .
This was developed by Dr. Kit Vaughan CEO of a company called Caperay
www.caperay.com
I recently introduced Dr. Kit Vaughn to Harvard Radiology Prof. Daniel Kopans
Dr Daniel Kopans is keen to collaborate with Dr. Kit Vaughan to combine
D B T with U S, a daunting and time-consuming task.
Here’s how Dr Kopans described the challenge:
\"DBT is done with the patient upright and the breast is compressed side to side and top to bottom. ABUS is presently done with the patient lying supine and the breast flattened out on the chest wall. The tissues are oriented completely differently between the two studies, making comparisons very difficult. They are now two separate studies taking twice as much time. If the two studies were done simultaneously in the same position and with the breast in the same orientation, comparing the findings would be immediate because the DBT and ABUS images would be registered with one another. We should be involved in the design and development of a new system that integrates DBT and ABUS in a single platform.\"
Simply stated, this new DBT-ABUS system would make it technically easier for the Radiologist to read films ,and reduce possible diagnostic errors.
Would detect more cancers at an earlier stage, particularly in women with dense breasts.
With one visit there would be far less anxiety while waiting for results.
Less Expensive than two consecutive visits.
Dr Vaughan has estimated that it would require $250,000 to build a clinic-ready system 
combining DBT and ABUS that would be sent to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston for Dr Kopans to evaluate.
To the thousands of men and women who have lost love ones to breast cancer, please help finance a machine that will undoubtedly save countless future women`s lives.
To the 40% of women with dense breast tissue, give that nasty Polar Bear nowhere to hide!
Sincerely
Ian

Are You Dense :: Home
Dense breast tissue is comprised of less fat and more connective tissue which appears white on a mammogram. Cancer also appears white thus tumors are often hidden by the dense tissue. As a woman ages, her breasts usually become more fatty. However, 2/3 of pre-menopausal and 1/4 of post menopausal women...

Become a Christian Today!
How do I become a Christian? Once you have asked all your questions, weighed all the evidence, and tested all the arguments, you will ultimately be confronted with the basic question Jesus asked his own disciples in Matthew 16:15 

‘But who do you say that I am?’ 

Simon Peter replied: 

‘You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.’ 

What is your reply? 

If you have come to the same conclusion as Simon Peter, you are a few steps away from having a personal relationship with our loving God. It is our sincere hope and prayer that each of you reach this conclusion, for we know that true happiness, joy and peace only come when we recognize our purpose for existing and yield our wills to our Creator. As you will see, Christianity is not based on a religious building, formula or ritual, it’s a matter of what you truly believe in your heart.

Become a Christian: Step through the Gospel 
First, you can be sure that God loves you unconditionally and desires to have a personal relationship with you. 

“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life” (John 3:16). 

Second, you need to admit your sinful nature to God, because this is what separates all of us from Him. 

“For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). 

Third, you should stop trying to please God through your own efforts, and realize that salvation through the blood of Jesus Christ is a gift that none of us deserves. 

“But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). 

Finally, you just need to step in and truly accept God’s gift -- His Son, Jesus Christ. 

“But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name” (John 1:12). 

So, now you know the basic steps to become a Christian. As a result, if you desire God’s gift of eternal life and fellowship with Him, you are as close as a sincere act of faith. 

Jesus says, 

“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me” (John 14:6). 

Jesus also says, 

“Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me” (Revelation 3:20). 

Receiving Jesus is a matter of truly asking Him to come into your life, to forgive your sins, and to become your Lord and Savior. It’s not merely an intellectual undertaking, but rather, an act of sincere faith and heart-felt will. 

If you want to receive Jesus now, and accept His gift of salvation, it's a matter of believing in Jesus Christ, repenting of your sins, and turning the rest of your life over to Him. This is not a ritual based on specific words, but rather, a prayerful guideline for your sincere step of faith. 

“Father, I know that I have broken your laws and my sins have separated me from you. I am truly sorry, and now I want to turn away from my past sinful life toward you. Please forgive me, and help me avoid sinning again. I believe that your son, Jesus Christ died for my sins, was resurrected from the dead, is alive, and hears my prayer. I invite Jesus to become the Lord of my life, to rule and reign in my heart from this day forward. Please send your Holy Spirit to help me obey You, and to do Your will for the rest of my life. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.”

\"Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost\" (Acts 2:38).

If you decided to become a Christian today, welcome to God's family. Now, as a way to grow closer to Him, the Bible tells us to follow up on our commitment.
Get baptized as commanded by Christ.
Tell someone else about your new faith in Christ.
Spend time with God each day. It does not have to be a long period of time. Just develop the daily habit of praying to Him"/t"2016-06-16T06:01:05+0000"/t"status"/tNA/t"14084625156_10157332090015157"/tNA/t0/t0/t0

Attention : Matthew Herper Esq,

Forbes Staff Writer.

Dear Matthew,

The letter that follows for your consideration for possible publication, is one of the most important letters/article I’ve ever written.(700 Words)

In 1958 I opened my practice as a family doctor.

That was a time when humanism prevailed.  Doctors could spend time with their patients, and listen to a laundry list of complaints

House calls were done on sick patients, a telephone call inquiry followed next day, to see how the patient was doing after surgery.

My article is written from the heart, as a father, and a doctor who truly cared!

I hope it gets published!

"453"/t"10202433244827781"/t"Angie B. Williams"/t"My name is Kim Bowens and I'm asking for help for my dear friend Coqueace \"KoCo\" Powell. She has stage 4 breast cancer and her medical bills are ridiculously high. During her previous round of chemo, we visited the hospital's business office and they handed her a medical bill totalling a little over $18,000. And that was for only 1 month. Battling cancer has taken its toll on KoCo mentally & physically. The last thing she needs weighting on her are expensive medical bills. Please give what you can to help my friend. Thanks for your support!
Here's Koco's story:
In 2011 and at the age of 36; I was diagnosed with estrogen positive breast cancer. I had no insurance. I was given a 50/50 change of living. I had a double mastectomy, 19 lymph nods removed, radical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, 6 rounds of chemo, and put on hormonal therapy. I went into remission.

In 2015 and at the age of 41; I had a recurrence.  I was diagnosed Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer which extended to my lymph nods and chest wall. I was given a 12% chance of living. So far I've had a double breast excision, 6 rounds of Tactotere chemo and 102 days of Xeloda chemo. I'm starting chemo plus radiation combo. I pray and have faith it will save my life. 

I never questioned God why. I try to inspire and motivate by using what I've been and going through.

I stay positive and keep pushing.

My name is Marie Antlova and my daughter Lucia have agressive brain tumor. Lucia was diagnosed with medulloblastoma in December at Motol hospital. Medulloblastoma is very fast growing tumor often removed chirurgically. She started going to chemotherapy in January but Lucia recently formed an allergic reaction. Main doctor said she have six months of life without operation. Unfortunately the insurance companies won't pay for her treatment because she have the insurance from second month of her life. We have been announced by the insurance company expert about that she have tumor from her birth.
Lucia needs surgery which remove her tumor. It's only way for Lucia's survival. The doctor recommended us the Heidelberg University Hospital in Germany. Surgery cost 50.000€. We can't afford her treatment.
We found possibility of fundraising. We have created fundraiser on YouCaring (https://www.youcaring.com/marie-antlova-514627).
We have started with foundation in February. It were already collected 12.600$ of total amount 53.000$. To our goal of foundation is missing 40.400$.

To the Thousands of Men who have lost loved ones to Breast Cancer.

To err is human, but when it comes to breast cancer, failure to diagnose, is hard to forgive

Over the years as a family doctor who practiced in both Canada and the United States for many years, I have seen the ravages of breast cancer, not only in my practice, but up close and personal.

My daughter Julie, on her 50th birthday, 23`rd June 2007, received the dreaded news that she had a large intraductal, invasive carcinoma, involving most of her left breast (15.7 cm x 4.3 cm)

All Julie`s previous mammograms had been negative. \"Never was an ultrasound ordered.\"

An astute physician, realizing Julie`s mother had died from breast cancer age 59, ordered an MRI.

.However, it was not until I read Nancy Cappello`s story recently, that I became aware of the importance of dense breast tissue that occurs in about 40% women www.areyoudense.com

In my own practice, many years ago, I missed a breast cancer in a 45-year-old woman, largely because I was totally unaware of  the problem dense breast tissue can create. Please take a moment to look at this video. http://youtu.be/Jow33EWcBAo

The D B T [digital breast tomosynthesis] mammography machine has made its appearance in certain areas the United States.

This D 3 (D B T) mammography machine is vastly superior to the D 2 generation, and may often reveal occult breast cancers that were missed previously. Frequently, ultrasound has to follow the mammogram, in order to rule out potential trouble

Harvard Radiology Professor Daniel Kopans, a world authority on Mammography, in collaboration with  Kit Vaughn PhD (CapeRay.www.com) , are now fully able to combine the D B T Mammography Machine with Ultra sound , but lack funds.

The advantages of this combination are that it makes the radiologists task of interpreting results much easier. It saves the woman a second trip back for an ultrasound, which is often necessary. It considerably saves the waiting time for a woman to get her results back. This waiting is invariably associated with high anxiety. 
The one visit IS IT\", reduces the cost of the two consecutive tests.

 These are the costs:
Kit Vaughan kit@caperay.com,
 I have two figures in mind:
1.To build a bare-bones prototype that accomplishes proof of concept: $100,000;
and 2. To build a beautiful clinic-ready system that we could ship to Massachusetts General Hospital
in Boston for Dan Kopans to evaluate, would require $250,000.

                                               Title;
To Err is Human , to forgive a  doctor  who fails to diagnose Breast Cancer,  hard to Forgive!

Over the years as a family doctor who practiced in both Canada and the United States for many years, I have seen the ravages of breast cancer, not only in my practice, but up close and personal.

In my own practice, many years ago, I missed a breast cancer in a 45-year-old woman. Please take a moment to look at this video. http://youtu.be/Jow33EWcBAo 

My daughter Julie, on the 50th birthday, 23`rd June 2007, received the dreaded news that she had a large intraductal, invasive carcinoma involving most of her left breast (15.7 cm x 4.3 cm)
All her previous mammograms had been negative, and it was only due to an astute physician ,realizing her mother had died from breast cancer age 59,  ordered an MRI.
Mammography has advanced by leaps and bounds since when I began practice in 1958.

However, it was not until I read Nancy Cappello`s story recently, that I became aware of the importance of dense breast tissue that occurs in about 40% women   www.areyoudense.com

The D B T [digital breast tomosynthesis] mammography machine has made its appearance in certain areas the United States.
This D 3 (D B T) mammography machine is vastly superior to the D 2 generation, and may often reveal occult breast cancers that were missed previously. Frequently, ultrasound has to follow the mammogram, in order to rule out potential trouble This all takes more time.
Over the years I have been fortunate in making contact with Harvard radiology Prof. Daniel Kopans.,a world authority on mammography, whose tireless efforts helped to create the D B T .

I introduced Prof. Kopan’s to Kit Vaughan PhD (WWW.CAPERAY.COM) ,a gentleman who is capable of combining the DBT with ultrasound.
Recently I received an e-mail from Daniel B. Kopans, M.D. Professor of Radiology,Harvard Medical School, a world authority on Mammography.

\"DBT is done with the patient upright and the breast is compressed side to side and top to bottom.
Ultrasound is presently done with the patient supine and the breast flattened out on the chest wall.
The tissues are oriented completely differently between the two studies making comparisons
very difficult. They are now two separate studies taking twice as much time. If the studies are
done in the same position and with the breast in the same orientation, simultaneously,
comparing the findings is immediate and facilitated because they are registered with one another.
I hope this answers the concerns.
We should be involved in design and development of the system\"

Put  into simple language:
The advantages of this combination are that it makes the radiologists task of interpreting results much easier. It saves the woman a second trip back for an ultrasound, which is often necessary. It considerably saves the waiting time for a woman to get her results back. This waiting is invariably associated with high anxiety. 
\"The one visit IS IT\", reduces the cost of the two consecutive tests.
This incredibly worthwhile project requires funds , which up to the present time have not been forthcoming.
These are the costs:
Kit Vaughan kit@caperay.com,
 I have two figures in mind:
1.To build a bare-bones prototype that accomplishes proof of concept: $100,000;
and 2. To build a beautiful clinic-ready system that we could ship to Massachusetts General Hospital
in Boston for Dan Kopans to evaluate, would require $250,000.

It is my sincere hope that this machine will be constructed in the not-too-distant future, and will replace the separate D3 and ultrasound units for many obvious reasons.
.
Breast cancer is primarily a woman`s disease. It is time for an activist woman to make sure the D 3/US Mammography machine does not wither and die because of lack of funds!
Here is hoping!
Sincerely,
Octogenarian

"575"/t"10207398357536996"/t"Ian Grant-whyte"/t"Funds are desperately  needed  see the  D B T/U S Mammogram Machine become a reality.

In spite of all the research, money collected , expert in the field ,cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States.
Over the years as a family doctor who practiced in both Canada and the United States for many years, I have seen the ravages of breast cancer, not only in my practice, but up close and personal.

My daughter Julie, on the 50th birthday, 23`rd June 2007, received the dreaded news that she had a large intraductal invasive carcinoma involving her left breast (15.7 cm x 4.3 cm)

All her previous mammograms  had been negative, and it was only due to an astute physician ,realizing  her mother had died from breast cancer age 59, ordered an MRI.(Dense breast tissue was presumably  the cause of the unreliable mammograms)

Mammography has advanced by leaps and bounds since when I began practice in 1958.

The  D B T [digital breast tomosynthesis] mammography machine has made its appearance in certain areas the United States. 

This D3 mammography machine is vastly superior to the D 2 generation, and  may often reveal occult breast cancers that were missed previously.

Nancy Cappello PhD, is a woman who has drawn the medical profession attention to the importance of dense breast tissue, that occurs in some 40% of women. Www.areyoudense.com is her website.

Nancy has taking her crusade to over 50% of the states in the United States. It now has become law that a radiologists mammography report has to state within the breast tissue is dense or not.

Over the years I have been fortunate in making contact with Harvard radiology Prof. Daniel Kopans.
Dr. Kopans is a world authority on mammography has been attempting to combine DBT with ultra sound, for many years 
. For technical reasons, this  has been a formidable task.

I put Prof. Kopan’s in touch with Kit Vaughan PhD (WWW.CAPERAY.COM) ,a gentleman who is capable of combining the DBT with ultrasound.

The advantages of this combination are that it makes the radiologists task of interpreting results much easier. It saves the woman a second trip back for an ultrasound, which is often necessary. It  considerably saves the waiting time  for a woman to get her results back. This waiting is invariably associated with high anxiety. 
\"The one visit IS IT\", reduces the cost of the two consecutive tests.

This email from Prof. Kopans came to me recently.
Ian,

DBT is done with the patient upright and the breast is compressed side to side and top to bottom. Ultrasound is presently done with the patient supine and the breast flattened out on the chest wall. The tissues are oriented completely differently between the two studies making comparisons very difficult. They are now two separate studies taking twice as much time.
If the studies are done in the same position and with the breast in the same orientation, simultaneously, comparing the findings is immediate and facilitated because they are registered with one another.
I hope this answers the concerns.
We should be involved in design and development of the system\"

This incredibly worthwhile project requires funds which up to the present time has not been forthcoming. These are the costs:
 
Kit Vaughan <kit@caperay.com, I have two figures in mind:
1.To build a bare-bones prototype that accomplishes proof of concept: $100,000;
and 2. To build a beautiful clinic-ready system that we could ship to Massachusetts General Hospital
in Boston for Dan Kopans to evaluate, would require $250,000.
 
It is my sincere hope that this machine will be constructed in the not-too-distant future, and will replace the separate D3 and ultrasound units, which will undoubtedly not be music to the ears of the manufacturers of the D3 unit!
 
                                     Here is hoping!
                                       Sincerely,

"679"/t"10155254110337892"/t"Lisa Main Lefebvre"/t"Dear friends,
I need your help! I am looking for women would would be willing to attend a focus group to talk about their Breast Cancer recovery experience. The views shared in these groups will help shape a new breast cancer recovery resource — both a clinic and online services.

There will be 4 groups in Manhattan, 2 in Minneapolis and 2 online groups during June 2016. Could you kindly help me spread the word? I am interested in speaking with women who have been diagnosed within the last 5 years (2011 onward).

Here are the links so that interested women can check their calendars and register:

New York Breast Cancer Recovery Focus Groups:
https://doodle.com/poll/pq6wq4rktcz2wp3s

Minneapolis Breast Cancer Recovery Focus Groups:
https://doodle.com/poll/uzkyrkaqd63wmqrt

Online Breast Cancer Recovery Focus Groups:
https://doodle.com/poll/bcddmcrdfty67f5u

Instructions for the links: This is a calendaring website. All an interested woman needs to do is enter her name and select the dates/times she could attend. The site will ask for her contact information in the process. I will contact her directly to confirm a final date/time and provide directions.

Thank you!
Lisa

PS Could you please help me spread word by re-posting??"/t"2016-05-24T19:25:14+0000"/t"link"/t"https://doodle.com/poll/pq6wq4rktcz2wp3s"/t"14084625156_10154863687652892"/tNA/t0/t0/t0

Thanks,

My relentless crusade to help women, young and old, find breast cancers early, 
began on June 23`rd  2007.

The report  below came to my daughter Julie, on her 50`th birthday, June 23 2007
                                     Scripps Memorial Hospital, La Jolla,
                                  La Jolla Radiology Medical Group. June 20 2007.
                                       Examination: Dynamic M.R. Mammography.
                                   MR Breast Bilateral. Very extensive involvement left breast,
                                            Invasive and intraductal carcinoma.
                                             Tumor Size: 15.7 cm by 4.3 cm
Julie’s tumor was the size of a fist, a large fist.
All Julie`s D 2 mammograms had been negative.
Never was the word'\" Ultrasound'' mentioned.
Julie`s mom ( my ex), died of breast cancer age 59.

Harvard Radiology Professor Dan Kopans, and Kit Vaughn(  www.Caperay.com)
are able to produce a state of the art D 3/ U S Combo mammogram machine,
but lack funds.
\"As Dr Kopans has described below, a system that combines 
DBT (digital breast tomosynthesis) and automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) 
in the same platform, has a number of important benefits:

1.  Since both sets of images would be acquired at the same time,
 there'd be a major time savings (10 minutes versus 20 to 30 minutes 
with two separate systems);
2.  Since both sets of images have the breast in the same orientation 
and degree of compression, the comparison of the images would be 
much easier; and the cost of the system would be considerably lower 
than the cost of two separate systems.

Assuming you are successful in raising the necessary funds
 for this development,then the first thing I’d do would be to visit
 Dr Kopans in Boston to discuss the design and development of the system.

All the best Kit.

Ian,
DBT is done with the patient upright and the breast is compressed side to side and top to bottom.  Ultrasound is presently done with the patient supine and the breast flattened out on the chest wall.  The tissues are oriented completely differently between the two studies making comparisons very difficult.  They are now two separate studies taking twice as much time.

If the studies are done in the same position and with the breast  in the same orientation, simultaneously, comparing the findings is immediate and facilitated because they are registered with one another.
I hope this answers the concerns.
We should be involved in design and development of the system\"
Dan

Office:  617-726-3093

Email:   dkopans@partners.org
What I had hoped for, is to find someone who had lost a wife,  
sister, daughter, mother in-law, or close friend,   might seize this opportunity 
 to donate the necessary funds to help woman kind.
 
Maybe you know, someone who knows someone. 
Too late for that unfortunate individual, but not  too late 
to try and prevent some of the 40,000 women in the USA,
 from dying each year, from untimely deaths.

Harvard`s Radiology Professor Dan Kopans and Cape  Ray( www.caperay.com)
can come to the rescue, of many women who die untimely deaths from breast cancer!

Certainly \"Ray Of Good Hope\" from Cape Ray!
Please Help! To save one life, Priceless!

Hello Ian,
 
I have two figures in mind:
 
1.  To build a bare-bones prototype that accomplishes proof of concept: $100,000; and
 
2.  To build a beautiful clinic-ready system that we could ship to Massachusetts General Hospital
 in Boston for Dan Kopans to evaluate, would require $250,000.
