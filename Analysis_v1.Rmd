### Project: Gail Score from Facebook

### Background

The Gail Score is a risk assessment tool to quantify a woman's risk for developing invasive breast cancer. Certain factors, such as age, race, and ancestral history can be indicative of future development. Based on a woman's Facebook profile, this model aims to quantify the risk of invasive breast cancer. For further information, see <http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool>. The tool provided utilizes the following variables to make a prediction: 

*Medical history of breast cancer or previous radiation therapy
*Mutation of either BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene
*Woman's age (>35)
*Age at time of first menstrual cycle
*How many first-degree relatives have breast cancer?
*Prior breast biopsy
*Race/ethnicity

### Thoughts about Method

Typical information that can be gathered from a woman's Facebook profile may include age, ethnicity, age at the time of first live birth, and how many first-degree relatives have breast cancer. While this information may not be directly stated on a profile, it could be obtained by data-scraping statuses posted by the individual, page likes, or past/future events the individual has or will attend. A potential dataset would be profiles scraped from Facebook of women over the age of 35 in the US. 

### Plan for Upcoming Week

* Look into data scraping from Facebook
    + See how to obtain such a dataset
* Learn more about how the underpinnings of the Gail Score and how the tool weights each of the variables
