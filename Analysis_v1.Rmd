### Project: Gail Score from Facebook

### Background

The Gail Score is a risk assessment tool to quantify a woman's risk for developing invasive breast cancer. Certain factors, such as age, race, and ancestral history can be indicative of future development. Based on a woman's Facebook profile, this model aims to quantify the risk of invasive breast cancer. For further information, see <http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool>. The tool provided utilizes the following variables to make a prediction: 

* Medical history of breast cancer or previous radiation therapy
* Mutation of either BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene
* Woman's age (>35)
* Age at time of first menstrual cycle
* How many first-degree relatives have breast cancer?
* Prior breast biopsy
* Race/ethnicity

### Question Development
#### General Question

What information from a woman's Facebook profile is most indicative of her risk for developing breast cancer? 

#### Concrete Question 

Based on a random sample of public profiles in the US, how can I weight characteristics to infer the risk of developing breast cancer? 

### Description of the Data and Method

Information utilized by the tool above may not be directly stated on a profile. However, it could be obtained by data-scraping statuses posted by the individual, page likes, or past/future events the individual has or will attend. A potential dataset would be profiles scraped from Facebook of women over the age of 35 in the US. Thresholds and methods would have to be developed to determine if liking a page (e.g. Susan G. Komen Organization) or using certain words in a status is indicative of any of the criteria mentioned above. 

### Updates Since 9/13/2016
* Created app through Facebook API
    + Obtained token from Facebook OAuth
* Downloaded Rfacebook package from CRAN/Github (Pablo Barbera)
    + Use access token for authentication in R 

### Current Issues
Under current version of app (v2.7), there is no method of getting other friends' information or public profiles -- need to find another way of getting this information 

### Plan for Upcoming Week

* Look into data scraping from Facebook
    + See how to obtain such a dataset
* Look into Facepager
    + <https://github.com/strohne/Facepager>
    + Data is stored in a SQL database and can be exported to csv
* Learn more about how the underpinnings of the Gail Score and how the tool weights each of the variables
