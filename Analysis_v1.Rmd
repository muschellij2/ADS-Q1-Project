### Project: Gail Score from Facebook

### Background

The Gail Score is a risk assessment tool to quantify a woman's risk for developing invasive breast cancer. Certain factors, such as age, race, and ancestral history can be indicative of future development. Based on a woman's Facebook profile, this model aims to quantify the risk of invasive breast cancer. For further information, see <http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool>. The tool provided utilizes the following variables to make a prediction: 

* Medical history of breast cancer or previous radiation therapy
* Mutation of either BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene
* Woman's age (>35)
* Age at time of first menstrual cycle
* How many first-degree relatives have breast cancer?
* Prior breast biopsy
* Race/ethnicity

### Thoughts about Method

Information utilized by the tool above may not be directly stated on a profile. However, it could be obtained by data-scraping statuses posted by the individual, page likes, or past/future events the individual has or will attend. A potential dataset would be profiles scraped from Facebook of women over the age of 35 in the US. Thresholds and methods would have to be developed to determine if liking a page (e.g. Susan G. Komen Organization) or using certain wordss in a status is indicative of any of the criteria mentioned above. 

### Plan for Upcoming Week

* Look into data scraping from Facebook
    + See how to obtain such a dataset
* Learn more about how the underpinnings of the Gail Score and how the tool weights each of the variables
