## Background

The Gail Score is a risk assessment tool to quantify a woman's risk for developing invasive breast cancer. Certain factors, such as age, race, and ancestral history can be indicative of future development. Based on a woman's Facebook profile, this model aims to quantify the risk of invasive breast cancer. For further information, see <http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool>. 

## Thoughts about Method

Typical information that can be gathered from a woman's Facebook profile may include age, ethnicity, age at the time of first live birth, and how many first-degree relatives have breast cancer. While this information may not be directly stated on a profile, it could be obtained by data-scraping statuses posted by the individual, page likes, or past/future events the individual has or will attend.
